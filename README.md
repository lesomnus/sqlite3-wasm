# sqlite3-wasm

**sqlite3-wasm** is a bridge that enables **Go (WASM)** code running in the browser to use a **separately loaded SQLite3 WASM instance** through JavaScript. I hope the [WebAssembly Component Model](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/) will soon be fully implemented in browsers so that this project can become **obsolete by design**.


## Motivation

The project started as a personal experiment to **use SQLite with OPFS directly from Go**.
