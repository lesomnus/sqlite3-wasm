# sqlite3-wasm

**sqlite3-wasm** is a bridge that enables **Go (WASM)** code running in the browser to use a **separately loaded SQLite3 WASM instance** through JavaScript.
I hope the [WebAssembly Component Model](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/) will soon be fully implemented in browsers so that this project can become **obsolete by design**.


## Acknowledgements

Most of the code in this project's `driver` package was written and tested with the assistance of **GPT-5 mini**.  
Some portions of the implementation were adapted from [ncruces/go-sqlite3](https://github.com/ncruces/go-sqlite3).


## Motivation

The project started as a personal experiment to **use SQLite with OPFS directly from Go**.


## Usage

TBD
